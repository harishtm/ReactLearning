Component Life Cycle Methods
==============================================================================

- When we create a react component the component goes through several stages.
  In its life cycle react provides us with built-in methods that we can override
  at particular stage in the life cycle.

- Life cycle methods available for class component. These methods doesn't exists
  on functional component. With the new feature of the hooks there is the use affect
  hoo which partially relates to the life cycle hooks.

    Mounting - Is called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted
               into the DOM.

    Updating - Is called when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes
               to either its props or state. 

    Unmounting - Is called when a component is being removed from the DOM

    Error Handling - When there is an error during rendering in a lifecycle method, or
                     in the construction of any child component

========================================================================================

1. Mounting methods - constructor, static method getDerivedStateFromProps, render and
                     ComponentDidMount

2. Updating methods - static method getDerivedStateFromProps again,
                      shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and
